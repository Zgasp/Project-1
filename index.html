					<h3>A Little Bit About Myself</h3>
					<p>My name is Zachary Gasparetti. I'm Italian and Polish. My major is Information Technology and Management.</p>
					<p>I'm really interested web development since art, design, architecture, and photography are some of my other interest and it pairs well with them. I feel their is also money to make in the field on the side of working for an IT job or while in school. My goal for this class is to finish it with enough knowledge and direction to try getting a job in it. I also like cats.</p>

			<h3>Tide Pods</h3>
			<p>Tide Pods are a funny meme from the internet that actually pretty dangerous. Most people are smart of enough to enjoy the meme and not actually eat them. However there is still an exception. From the stories of those that <i>actually</i> have eaten them. The soap inside is super concentrated in order to clean an entire load of clothes with one little package. The downside of this is that it only makes it more dangerous. Since the esophagus is inside the body, it is moist. The soap in Tide Pod soap is water activated. And when one gets this down their throat, they can't spit it out. The soap full on liquefies the esophagus. If medical treatment is not administered in the next couple hours, the person will die.</p>
