					<h3>A Little Bit About Myself</h3>
					<p>My name is Zachary Gasparetti. I'm Italian and Polish. My major is Information Technology and Management.</p>
					<p>I'm really interested web development since art, design, architecture, and photography are some of my other interest and it pairs well with them. I feel their is also money to make in the field on the side of working for an IT job or while in school. My goal for this class is to finish it with enough knowledge and direction to try getting a job in it. I also like cats.</p>
